# Sandbox

This is a communications app. There was a FOSS Hack on 27th and 28th of July, 2024, where the software I tried to release failed miserably so here I am, in all my frustration, trying to create a software in less than 5 days to vent and get over the frustration of my failure.

## This app/software will be run by IdiotNgine
